# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Overview

This was a payroll tracker that wasn't working. My plan after realizing that it wasn't working was to check the JavaScript for any errors.
After checking the DevTools and seeing several errors in the console, I noticed the functions were incomplete.

## How to Use

First open the website, after opening the website you'll see an empty roster and an "Add Employees" button.

After clicking the "Add Employees" button you'll be given a prompt to input information about the employee.
You can add as many employees as you'd like, once you're done adding employees pressing cancel on the prompt "Add another Employee" will close the prompt.
All the employees will be listed in alphabetical order of their last name.
You can even open the DevTools and view the console, in the console you'll see the Average Salary of the employees and one employee that was selected randomly.
